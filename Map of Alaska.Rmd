library(leaflet)
library(dplyr)
library(ggmap)
library(rgdal)
library(htmltools)
library(mapview)
library(htmlwidgets)

#Load counties shape file.
counties <- readOGR("~/GitHub/Data-Products/data/tl_2013_02_cousub/tl_2013_02_cousub.shp")
#Filter for Alaska
ak_counties <- subset(counties, counties$STATEFP == "02")

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  setView(lng = -149.4937, lat = 64.2008, zoom = 4) %>%
  addPolygons(data = ak_counties)
m
